<p align="left"> The detailed anaysis of the deceased based on age and gender distributions has been presented here. This throws light on the past trends of vulnerability of people which can be helpful to understand the patterns upto now and take necessary precautions. </p>

<h4>Karnataka Age Distribution</h4>
<br>
<p align="left"> The graph below represents the age distribution of the deceased COVID-19 patients in Karnataka along with the total population distribution of Karnataka for reference. Out of all cases, eight have unknown ages and eleven have unknown gender.</p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/kaAgePop.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/kaAgePop.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left"> The filled in blue color indicates the distribution of the deceased coronavirus patients in Karnataka and the red outline represents the actual population
<p align="left"> By analysing the graph, we can infer that people around the age of 50-70 have the highest number of deceased patients, while people around the age of 0-40 have very less death count when compared to the demographic of Karnataka. One reason for this could be that the younger people have better immunity to fight the virus compared to the elderly.</p>
<br><hr><br>

<h4>Wave 1 and Wave 2 Age Distribution</h4>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
 <a href="./graphs/Wave1AgePop.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/Wave1AgePop.png" style="width:100%"></a>

 <a href="./graphs/Wave2AgePop.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/Wave2AgePop.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
  </div>
<br>
<p align="left">The graphs present wave 1 and wave 2 deceased COVID-19 patients age distribution along with the total population distribution of Karnataka for reference. Though the trends in wave 1 and wave 2 are almost similar, the deceased population between 0-40 has increased during wave 2 than wave 1, but still the highest deaths is observed in 50-70 age interval.</p>
<br><hr><br>

<h4>Age and Gender Distribution for every wave</h4>
<br>
<p align="left"> The entire data collected has been analysed wave wise to get a better understanding of the impact of Covid-19 and the nature of victims. </p>
<ul align="left">
  <li>Wave 1 - till the end of October 2020</li>
  <li>Middle wave - from the end of October till the end of January 2021</li>
  <li>Wave 2 - till the end of January 2021 till present</li>
</ul>
<p align="left"> In all the below graphs, the yellow color indicates the males while the blue indicates the females. 	
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/wave1AgeDistr.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/wave1AgeDistr.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left">This is the graph of deceased COVID-19 patients during wave 1, analysing the male and female deaths in each age group.This indicates that people around the age of 60 have the highest death count. But across the entire distribution, we can observe that the males have been more affected than the females.</p>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/midWaveAgeDistr.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/midWaveAgeDistr.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left">This is the graph of deceased coronavirus patients during the middle wave. From this graph, we understand that the gender trend of death count of males being higher than females still persists, though the total death count overall has reduced drastically compared to wave 1. Again, the peak count is around people of age 60-70.</p>
<br>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/wave2AgeDistr.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/wave2AgeDistr.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left">This graph depicts the deceased patients during this wave 2. Observing this graph, it is seen that the number of deceased has increased compared to the previous waves. Though the male death count does seem to high, the death count of female has increased compared to the previous waves and the overall difference between the males and females deceased count has reduced. The peak age of deceased is still around 60-70, but the death count of people of age around 30-40 and 40-50 has increased compared to previous waves, thus extending the range of affected victims.</p>

<h4>Wave based Age and Gender Distribution</h4>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
 <a href="./graphs/ageAcrossWaves.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/ageAcrossWaves.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
 <a href="./graphs/totalDeathsAcrossWaves.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/totalDeathsAcrossWaves.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left">From these graphs, we can see that the number of deceased in the middle wave is very less. This could be because of many reasons, like the climatic condition, increased immunity in people against the earlier mutant etc.. But the death count has increased a lot in the second wave across all ages compared to the first wave.</p>
<br><hr><br>

<h4>Confidence Interval</h4>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/waveCI.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/waveCI.png" style="width:100%"></a>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left"> We can see that there is no drastic differences in the variance across districts. Observing the interval plot for the first wave, the mean age of deceased patients district wise, arranged in descending order, has a maximum mean age of 63 at Uttara Kannada district and minimum mean age of 57 at Chikkaballapura district. On the other hand, maximum mean age of 66 at Udupi district and minimum mean age of 53 at Raichur district.</p>

<h4>Wave 1 and Wave 2 comparison</h4>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/waveScatter.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/waveScatter.png" style="width:100%"></a>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left">This is a plot of number of deceased in wave 1 versus the number of deceased in wave 2, with the point size indicating the sum of deaths in the two waves, done district wise. We can infer from this graph that the highest number of deaths in both the waves is with Mysuru while the least number of deceased patients is in Chitradurga. In Bengaluru Rural, wave 2 deaths is more than wave 1, while on the contrary, in Dakshina Kannada the wave 1 deaths is high compared to wave 2.</p>
<br><hr><br>

<h4>District based Age distribution</h4>
<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/ageScatter.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/ageScatter.png" style="width:100%"></a>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left">As we can see, in this plot, most of the overlapping across different districts and ages is under count of 30, but Bengaluru Urban's trend seems to be slightly different.</p>

<br>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12">
 <a href="./graphs/ageBoxPlot.html" target=top>   <img src="./graphs/ageBoxPlot.png" style="width:100%"></a>
  </div>
</div>
<br>
<p align="left">This plot, across districts, suggest that the median age of the deceased from every district is around 60 mostly, consistent with the general overall trends and across waves. We can see that the maximum number of outliers can be observed with Bengaluru Urban while Bidar has no outliers.</p>

<h4>Analysis based on number of deceased District wise</h4>
<br>
<div class="row">

  </div>
  </div>
<br>
<p align="left">These three graphs are the age distribution district wise with the total death count in the district being less than 500, 500-1000, and more than 1000. </p>
<br><hr><br>

<h4>Monthwise Age Distribution</h4>

<p align="left">The graphs represent monthwise death count and death percentage of people belonging to three different age categories, namely, 0-45, 45-60 and above 60.</p>
