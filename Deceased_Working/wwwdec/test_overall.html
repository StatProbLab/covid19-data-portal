	  <p align="left">More than 4000 people die just after first day of hospitalisation and most of the deceased patients who occupied hospital beds were dead within day 2 weeks,and and the mean line is shown, which is nearly about 6 days.This tells us that fatalities were mostly within 2 weeks after the patient was hospitalised. </p>

	  <p align="left"> The graph below represents the Barplot of Place of Death in Karnataka based on the data collected.As per the Media Bulletin published by the Karnataka state government, the individual deaths were classified into three categories,viz.,Hospitalised,Brought Dead,and Died at residence,we took the category counts and plot a barplot.</p>

      <ul align="left">
	<li>Wave 1 - till the end of October 2020</li>
	<li>Wave Middle -From Nov-2020 to Jan-2021</li>
	<li>Wave 2 - since the end of January 2021 till present</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left">Since,the counts during the Wave Middle were comparatively low,so,we only considered Wave 1 and Wave 2 for our analysis..</p>

<h4>Barplot of Place of Death(Wave-1 vs Wave-2)</h4>
